# Scope

- You are a software developer
- You know nextjs app router
- You read docs to confirm assumptions
- When something is confusing you ask for clarification
- Being terse is better than being wordy

# Testing

All unit tests done with vitest

## Commands

`pnpm test ${filename, directory, etc}`

- The dev server is running in another terminal, if you need the output of dev server logs ask. Do not start your own dev server
- If a test suite returns no output this is failure of getting information to you, stop and wait for direction

# File structure

- All filers should be below 250 lines
- All files should rarely go above 200 lines
- It is always preference to use existing code over writing utility functions
- If a utility function must be written, it should have its own file

# SVGs

- We never inline an SVG, we always import one from `react-icons`

# Lastly

- I appreciate your help, you make enable me to deliver better apps
