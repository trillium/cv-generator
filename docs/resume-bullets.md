# 📌 Key Learnings for Writing Resume Bullet Points

## 🎯 Purpose of Resume Bullets

- A resume is a **commercial document**: its job is to **generate interview requests**, not to catalog every task.
- Hiring managers care about **impact and results**, not just duties.

---

## ✅ Best Practice: Performance-Based Bullets

- Use the **Action – Number – Method** pattern:
  - **Action** → What you did (improved, reduced, built, automated).
  - **Number** → Quantify the outcome (30% faster, 5x throughput, saved 20 hours/week).
  - **Method** → How you did it (via refactoring, deploying clusters, automation, etc.).
- This shows measurable **impact** and makes you stand out.

## ⚠️ Common Bullet Styles (and Issues)

1. **Event-based**

   - Examples: _Shipped, Launched, Migrated_.
   - Problem: Too vague — doesn’t show _how well_ you did it.

2. **Administrative**

   - Examples: _Responsible for, Attended meetings, Conducted tests_.
   - Problem: Looks like a job description; doesn’t prove ability or results.

3. **Organizational**
   - Examples: _Joined, Assigned to, Worked on, Transferred_.
   - Problem: Focuses on company structure, not your contributions.
   - ✅ Exception: _Promoted / Selected to Join_ → shows recognition of your performance.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Quantify everything** — numbers are persuasive.
- **Performance beats duties** — focus on impact, not tasks.
- **Promotions matter** — include them as proof of achievement.
- **Avoid filler bullets** — administrative/organizational details don’t get interviews.
